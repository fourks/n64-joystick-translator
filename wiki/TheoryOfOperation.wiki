#summary Brief overview of how the translator works

= Theory of Operation =

Most josticks today are made with potentiometers. The potentiometer will output a voltage proportional to the amount a joystick is pushed. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer Potentiomers on Wikipedia]

However, the N64 joystick works in a different way, using two rotary encoders. This is essentially the same as the way ball computer mice work (though they have all but died out). [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder Rotary Encoders on Wikipedia]

== Code Flow ==

To successfully swap the rotary style joystick with the potentiometer style joysticks, the potentiometer voltages must be translated into rotary encoder-esque signals. This is accomplished with a simple microcontroller following the following flow: (only one axis is shown, in reality everything here happens twice for two dimensions)

== Translated Output State Machine ==

The upward, downward, left, and right movements follow a simple state machine:
